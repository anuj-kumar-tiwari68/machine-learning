My machine learning learning path and projects
# 🧠 My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my machine learning learning repo!  
This is where I document everything I practice — from the basics of scalars and tensors, to building real ML projects.  

It’s my **learning diary + portfolio**, showing my growth step by step. 🚀
